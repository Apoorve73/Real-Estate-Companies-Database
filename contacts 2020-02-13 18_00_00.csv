""  I enjoy playing badminton, volleyball, swimming. These have truly helped me gain self-confidence, learn  team skills, helped me challenge and push the limits of my strength!  Working at HPE, I realized I could spend my evenings cooking different interesting stuffs! This made me realize how important work-life balance(WLB) is! And thus, I seek a great WLB in my professional career.  I am not a big fan of reading, but I read few stories(Matilda, Charlie and the chocolate factory) written by Roald Dahl recently, which surely is very interesting and have developed my interest in reading books for now.  Academically, I've always been in the top 10%. I enjoy finding logics , may it be ranging from technical questions(developing algorithms)  to  even the silliest questions in day-to-day banters.

I am a connector: A relationship builder with an innate ability to observe, learn and understand. I facilitate information exchange; breaking down silos and helping teams deliver more effectively.   I am a driver:  I impact business outcomes by helping clients get what they need through effective prioritization and impeccable delivery.  I am an igniter and multiplier: I am passionate about growing the capabilities of my team and helping people find their great work!";"barb_bidan";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"InVision";"SVP, People";"Jul 2019";"PRESENT";"";"Richardson, TX, United States";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/invisionapp";"invisionapp";;;"InVision";"Vice President, Global Talent Attraction";"Jun 2018";"Jun 2019";"";"";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/invisionapp";"invisionapp";;;"Indeed.com";"Vice President, Global Talent Attraction";"Apr 2015";"May 2018";"";"Dallas/Fort Worth Area";"https://www.linkedin.com/company/indeed-com";"indeed-com";;;"Yahoo!

ObjectSpectrum is a rapid software development environment built for the IoT industry and based on JavaScript Microservices.  These microservices are building blocks that can quickly be assembled to create a minimally viable product (application) for IoT solutions.  From that point the MVP can be quickly iterated until the desired fully functional product is created.  This can be done in any cloud environment and is of production quality and ready for deployment any time along the iteration process.  For more information go to: www.objectspectrum.com  The ObjectSpectrum platform is secure, scalable, reliable, and perhaps more importantly, specifically designed for rapid deployment and long-term maintainability of IoT applications. Its modular ""separation of concerns""​ architecture leverages common and widely-used technologies, like JavaScript Microservices on the edge and server, and JSON, HTML, and SVG on the client. Combined with solid documentation, a library of quick-start templates, and world-class developer support, the result is shorter learning curves and faster time to productivity for your team.  In addition to the platform software, we also offer Professional Services from both our own team of IoT experts and from our network of partners that each bring their own industry and application specific knowledge to the table.

I speak regularly on the topics of IoT/M2M, Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) and the various technologies that will enable this revolution. See projects section.  We live in exponential times. Sensors, microprocessors and devices will continue to drop in price and increase in compute power. Connectivity technologies like cellular, satellite, wireline, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, mesh, etc. will be joined by powerful LPWAN technologies that will enable low cost, long range, deep-building penetration and long-battery-life connectivity that will make possible applications that were never practical before. These and many other exponential technologies will transform our lives in ways we can't imagine.

(93-page technical describing the 300-person years of development can be found at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2kf1mcyd7y0qeh/RPMA_Technology_v_3_0.pdf?dl=0 )  My role is to educate application/solution providers, device/sensor makers and systems integrators/VARs/MVNOs on how to utilize this enabling technology to create IoT/M2M solutions and applications.  Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio will be among the first in the world to have access to this public ""cellular network exclusively for machines"". Whatever solutions are created for this network now can be easily enabled as our network is turned on in each new city and country around the world. Because the frequencies we use are the same in every country all around in the world, then the product you create can used everywhere... ONE NETWORK... ONE SKU.  Let me know if I can explain and/or answer any questions about Ingenu, its technology and rollout plans for the world (100 cities in the US by the end of 2017 and 50+ countries around the globe in 2016/2017).  Operating on the universal 2.4 GHz spectrum available worldwide, our RPMA® technology is a proven standard for connecting IoT and M2M devices. Ingenu has deployed 38 private networks around the world over the last eight years, and has invested over 300 person-years in development and enhancements to create a highly reliable and secure commercial-grade wireless IoT/LPWAN network.  The Machine Network™ will have further range, deeper penetration and longer lasting battery life than any existing network with unmatched global reach. It is highly scalable and is also future-proof (we'll guarantee 15+ years network availability).

This approach to leadership has served me well as an executive and now as a Vistage Chair, leading private advisory boards for CEOs, business owners, and other business leaders to help them step out of the day-to-day to think differently, gain insights, make better decisions, take bold action, and generate meaningful results.  The power of Vistage is in the layered experience and built-in accountability: private advisory board + one-to-one coaching + expert-led workshops. And the results speak for themselves. Membership in Vistage has been shown to accelerate business growth for small to mid-sized companies by more than 2.2 times (according to Dun & Bradstreet data).  My personal career experience has shown me that a collaborative approach yields the best overall results. I view business as a team sport – you win by giving people space to operate and guidance to succeed. Keeping your sense of humor – and losing your ego – is also important. When you’re focused on results, there’s no time to focus on yourself.  I’m looking for like-minded people to join my new Vistage group for CEOs in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. If you are an exceptional performer who wants to perform even better and learn from other accomplished leaders in a fun, high-energy environment, it sounds like Vistage is a perfect fit for you.

I was quickly tapped to help with restructuring the sales organization which was hard hit with the turn down of the post 2000 technology bubble ending Tundra’s 15 quarters or growth.  Revenue that had plunged from $10M/qtr to $5M/qtr was reversed with a tighter strategic focus on the customers pursued, alignment of our marketing and marcom efforts and improving and expanding our sales network. Metrics were added to assure a smooth operation as revenues climbed to $20M/qtr  I continued to enhance worldwide sales by establishing a strict policy on monitoring customer’s order rate. Column pricing was adjusted accordingly and I was able to report an additional $1M+ of margin dollars in this program’s first year.  I expanded sales again with another distributor and my team added ship and debit capability allowing the military customers to be serviced that yielded another $500K/yr of revenue.  By replacing underperforming sales reps with sales reps who also sold complementary lines, our presence and sales with our strategic customers improved. Training was added and new metrics monitored to assure top performance by all independent sales rep companies.  The most exciting time was spent with our Mergers and Acquisition group. During the due diligence of acquiring a much needed semiconductor product from IBM Microelectronics, I knew a market lead could be achieve if a proper roll out strategy was created. The decision was made and this pre-production product was cultivated to $14M of total revenue during the next five years surpassing expectations.  Efficiency and relationships were enhanced with the creation of a sales rep council to increase the communication between Tundra executive team and the sales rep presidents contributing to greater mind share.
