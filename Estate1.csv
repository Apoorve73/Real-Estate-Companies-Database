As a result, we increased sales by 25% and the sales rep went on to win a performance award. The second community was an upscale, move-up line of homes. Again, sales were lagging. I identified several contributing factors: Sales rep underperformance, an over-optioned model home, prices not in line with area comparables and advertising. I coached the sales rep out of the organization, recommended a re-model within the community, established a new line-up of smaller homes to compete in the market and adjusted our target market and advertising.

I also help homeowners facing foreclosure or distress sale by buying real estate in Memphis, TN, and Dallas, TX, and selling it to real estate investors to increase their portfolios and meet their investing objectives.  HOW I DO IT: I source distressed properties and work with homeowners who urgently need to sell. I get a repair estimate from a licensed contractor as well as an appraisal from a licensed appraiser, which takes the speculation out of the transaction for the investor. They'll know the price they're buying for, exactly how much they will put into the property, and what it will be worth to resell or to rent when they're done.  WHO I WORK WITH: •	Distressed homeowners •	Buy and hold real estate investors •	Rehab and resell investors •	Real estate agents •	Other wholesalers •	Bank asset managers •	Cash buyers •	Private money lenders •	Title companies, real estate brokers, appraisers, contractors  WHY IT WORKS: New and part-time investors can either lose deals or make bad decisions if they don't know what they're getting into, but my prep work removes that problem by giving them an entire picture of the potential transaction before they commit to it.   WHY I DO IT: I have always loved real estate, and I love helping people. Now I'm the intersection of helping people get out of homes they no longer want and helping investors give those homes new life. My work helps people, saves credit, improves neighborhoods, and generates income.  READY TO TALK?

I am a born Entrepreneur from South Africa and epitome of the American Dream! My full time attention is devoted to the USA launch of Natalie Mills Jewelry brand & STATURE for Men. I am a firm believer in living by Faith. Inspiring people and Dreaming Big! My love for jewelry started at a young age - 8, I would take sea shells, thread them to make bangles and necklaces and sell them to the neighbours. At 11, I would purchase stationery from the local wholesaler and sell stationery to the school kids. I was a born Entrepreneur. My first professional position was at 18 in the marketing, advertising, event management and sponsorship industry. I was involved in coordinating sponsorships for Olympic Games,  All Africa Games & in SA's biggest sporting events. I then became Business Manager for Millionaire Media and Ecom Group. I was responsible for African Millionaire and Prestige Magazine, which was the inhouse magazine for Barclays Bank Africa. I travelled all over Africa & Globally, to secure business partnerships & awareness for the publications. At 25 I started my own business & partnered with Absa Bank, a division of Barclays PLC, for a programme I created called Absa One Call Home Solution, successful partnership since 2005. My passion for property lead to the launch of Chas Everitt Johannesburg, which is now the leading real estate agency in our area & top 4 in SA! In 2012 my love for jewelry led me to envision an opportunity in the market for high quality jewelry at affordable prices. Crystal Creations by Natalie Mills was created. I have grown my brand from a bracelet to a full scope accessory brand, available in over 500 retail & boutique stores across Africa, stand alone stores and succeeded with the launch of STATURE - a fashion line of mens unique Jewelry.

A solar brokerage—When solar companies compete, your clients win!  We are dealers for SunRun, Vivint and SunPower. On top of that, we’re a full EPC, as well.  By providing unbiased advise and a competitive platform for the big brands to compete we’re eliminating all headaches and guesswork for homeowners.  Solar brokers earn $800-$1500+ per kW —way more than the industry standard.  Managers earn $100+ per kW in overrides for team building.  Our main focus is on energy storage as well as production. With the utility companies changing NEM to time-of-use it’s making solar less valuable. But with battery storage, the investment of your clients is fully protected.  The panels we use are all Tier 1 panels like Solaria, LG, Panasonic, Canadian Solar, Solar World, etc. We provide Enphase / Solar Edge with every system and we coat our panels with Nano Power which self cleans them.  We also send your clients on a free cruise as an added bonus.  On top of that, there’s no such thing as failed credit with us. If there’s a client that doesn’t qualify due to credit, our solar brokers still get paid $200/kW by plugging them through our $0 out of pocket credit restoration program.

In common parlance most jurisdictions require the appearer to sign before a notary public.The practice of a Notary Public designating themselves as a Signing Agent has arisen. They specializes in the notarization of real estate transfers & loan document signings. Signing agents often have certification & training through private organizations but is not a requirement in law, but may generally be a requirement of the lender.  Also referred to as a Notary Signing Agent or a Loan Signing Agent, a signing agent should not be confused with a mortgage loan closer or closing agent. Signing Agents are notaries public who usually have experience and/or training concerning the proper execution of loan documents and are hired by mortgage companies, escrow companies, title companies, and signing services to identify loan documents, obtain the necessary signatures, and in some cases deliver the documents to the borrower. A Signing Agent is an impartial party to the transaction and must adhere to their state or jurisdiction notary laws. In some states of the United States where Signing Agents are allowed, Signing Agents may identify documents and can point out terms to the loan transaction. However, Signing Agents are prohibited from giving legal advice or in any way explaining or interpreting the meaning of any terms or documents and can not prepare the documents or alter them in any way. Any advice, explanation, or opinion can be considered unauthorized practice of law except in the State of Louisiana which is governed by Civil Law and their Civil Law notaries public have broad powers and can actually prepare documents and discuss them with the signers.

I worked on City Business documents and for their private practice the law areas were Real Estate, Wills and Probate and Non-Contested Divorces.   Paralegal is a term used in many countries (a.k.a. jurisdictions) to describe non-lawyers who assist lawyers in their legal work.  Paralegals are not lawyers. They are not authorized by the government to offer legal services in the same way, nor are they officers of the court (i.e. considered a formal part of the legal system), nor are they usually subject to government-/court-sanctioned rules of conduct.  Paralegals originated as assistants to lawyers at a time when only lawyers offered legal services. In those jurisdictions, such as the United States, where the local legal profession/judiciary is involved in paralegal recognition/accreditation then the profession of paralegal still basically refers to those people working under the direct supervision of a lawyer. In other jurisdictions however, such as the United Kingdom, the lack of local legal profession/judiciary oversight means that the definition of paralegal encompasses non-lawyers doing legal work, regardless of who they do it for. Although most jurisdictions recognize paralegals to a greater or lesser extent, there is no international consistency as to definition, job-role, status, terms and conditions of employment, training, regulation or anything else and so each jurisdiction must be looked at individually.","","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Faires%20and%20Garrett%2C%20Attorneys%20at%20Law",,,,"J.

Allison, II, Attorney at Law","Legal Assistant","Aug 1992","Aug 1993","Area of Law: Family Law  A paralegal or llegal assistant is a trained person, often with certification from state or government agencies, who performs a variety of support jobs for supervising lawyers. The paralegal cannot give legal advice, represent people in court, or sign any legal documents, except in the capacity of a notary if the person has been certified. Most people train to become a paralegal through either two-year or four year degrees at the college level, and they must be gifted at secretarial work, legal research and writing in order to perform their jobs proficiently.  There are many things that a legal assistant might do as employed by a lawyer or law firm. They can draft contracts, and most other legal documents, which are then reviewed by lawyers to be certain they conform specifically to the requirements of the client and the law. They also perform legal research, and may in the defense or prosecution of a person, do much of the research that will help support arguments in the court setting or in legal briefs.  The legal assistant may also perform preliminary interviews of clients, and/or witnesses. A legal assistant employed in the real estate field may be present at the closing of real estate sales. Since there are so many branches of law, a legal assistant may be particularly versed in different branches. Through training, they come into the field ready to work in just about any area, but their own interests may further help legal assistants specialize in certain kinds of law.

Hard money loans do not follow conventional standards that are required by banks or mortgage brokers, which allows you to obtain maximum leverage for a distressed property as well as to obtain funding for repairs. When working with a hard money lender, you will be able to finance your residential investment property as if you were paying cash, and we all know “cash is king”.  ✔ Landlord and Rental Property Loans A landlord loan, or rental property loan, is a three step loan process available to those looking to rent out their real estate investment property. The process begins by obtaining a hard money or rehab loan to fund the property plus repair cost, however once repairs are complete the property is refinanced into a 30 year fixed conventional loan, with potentially no money out of pocket.  ✔ Broker Program Sherman Bridge is proud to originate loans for brokers with our broker program. When you become a broker with Sherman Bridge, you are offered an opportunity to represent one of the best lenders for real estate investors. Work side-by-side with Sherman Bridge and supply borrowers with excellent, low-interest loans for their investments. Learn more here.  WHO WE SERVE: ✔ The Real Estate Flipper ✔ The Landlord ✔ Brokers  OUR CUSTOMERS LOVE US: ""I wanted to invest in real estate to boost my retirement funds but was nervous about finding the best lender. I was surprised how fast Sherman Bridge pre­approved me, and my rate was quoted way lower than any of the other lenders I had found. With the loan calculator, I compared Sherman Bridge's rate to other lenders and sure enough, I was getting a better deal than other lenders could offer. I’ve financed my investments with Sherman Bridge ever since.
