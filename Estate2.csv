They started Power House to get away from the big real estate agencies that charge a lot in fees and commissions. They hire experienced agents and only charge a small monthly due. In turn that gives the agents more flexibility with clients and the amount of marketing tools to generate higher returns for all parties. The bottom line is Power House agents aren't handing over half of their income to the big box agencies, and that gives them more incentive to do better for their clients. You're not just a sale or a number, you're a relationship that they care about for life. That being said, Power House and their agents are here to help you, and answer your questions whether your're a current client or just curious to how the process works.
